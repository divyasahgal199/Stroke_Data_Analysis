 Step 1: Understand the Problem
Analyze factors associated with stroke and possibly build a predictive model.
Target variable: stroke (1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke)

 Step 2: Collect the Data
Use a public dataset like the Stroke Prediction Dataset on Kaggle.
Save it as stroke_data.csv.
step 3:
read the data 
Step 4: Explore the Data (EDA)
Understand structure: df.info(), df.describe(), df.head()
Check for missing values: df.isnull().sum()
Class balance: df['stroke'].value_counts()
Visualize:
Countplot for stroke
Boxplots for numerical features vs. stroke
Correlation matrix
Step 5: Preprocess the Data
Handle missing values (e.g., bmi)
Encode categorical columns (gender, smoking_status, etc.)
Normalize numeric columns if needed
Optionally drop unnecessary columns (id)
Step 6: Feature Selection
Keep important features: age, hypertension, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, bmi, etc.
 Step 7: Build a Machine Learning Model
Split into train/test
Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
Evaluate using:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1
Confusion Matrix
Step 8: Interpret Results
Which features are most predictive?
Any bias (e.g., towards predicting no stroke)?
Step 9: Visualize Key Insights
Stroke rate by age group
Stroke vs. hypertension
Glucose level distribution
Feature importance from model
